# Flutter_Word_Combinator

Hi, everyone! This is my first Flutter project.\
Flutter Word Combinator is a simple, fun application built with Flutter that randomly generates unique combinations of two English words. Users can either like the combined word and add it to their favorites list or skip to the next random combination.
